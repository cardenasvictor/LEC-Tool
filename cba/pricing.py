pricing.py — Insurance layer pricing and actuarial coherence diagnostics
========================================================================

This module addresses a structural vulnerability of the LEC-CBA framework:
the Rate-on-Line (ROL) of the parametric insurance layer is an *exogenous*
parameter. Nothing in the framework checks whether the ROL the analyst types
is consistent with the loss curve that generates the payouts. A ROL that is
appropriate for a remote layer, applied to a frequent layer, produces an
artificially attractive benefit-cost ratio for insurance.

Two independent capabilities are provided.

1. MARKET ROL CURVE (``rol_from_return_period``)
   A monotone interpolation of a reinsurance pricing curve expressed as
   ROL versus the return period of the attachment point. Reinsurance
   pricing is conventionally quoted this way: the more remote the layer,
   the lower the rate per unit of limit.

   The default anchors below are a practitioner calibration for sovereign
   catastrophe risk. They are NOT a market quote and must be replaced with
   broker indications when those are available.

       Return period (years) :   1     5    10    25    50   100   200   500  1000
       Rate-on-Line          : 40%   35%   25%   22%    9%    5%  4.5%    4%  3.5%

   These anchors are a market indication for Central America and the
   Caribbean obtained from a practising reinsurance broker. They are a
   point-in-time indication, not a binding quotation, and should be
   refreshed at each renewal cycle.

   Interpolation is PCHIP (monotone cubic Hermite) in log-log space.
   A high-order polynomial through these anchors was evaluated and
   rejected: it exhibits Runge oscillation and returns negative rates
   between and beyond the anchors.

   For documentation purposes a smooth closed form is also provided
   (``rol_quadratic_closed_form``), a least-squares quadratic in log-log
   space that reproduces the anchors with R^2 = 0.9915 in logs and a
   maximum absolute error of 11 per cent. The closed form is intended for
   the conceptual note; the interpolation is what the code uses.

2. COHERENCE DIAGNOSTIC (``diagnose_insurance_pricing``)
   Given the simulated payouts actually produced by the layer, the
   diagnostic recovers the price the analyst is implicitly assuming and
   compares it with actuarial benchmarks:

       pure ROL         = E[annual payout] / ceded limit
       implied multiple = premium / E[annual payout]

   The implied multiple is the number of currency units of premium charged
   per unit of expected loss. Values below 1.0 mean the insurer is selling
   below expected loss, which no reinsurer does. Sovereign catastrophe
   programmes typically price between 1.2 and 3.0.

   Following the diagnose-do-not-stop convention already used elsewhere in
   this codebase for absurd inputs, the diagnostic never raises. It flags
   and lets the analysis run.

The curve is OFF by default. Existing configurations are unaffected: unless
``InsuranceConfig.pricing_mode`` is changed, the premium is computed exactly
as in previous versions.

    attaching at the same point receive the same rate per unit of limit,
    even though the wide layer carries far more expected loss per unit of
    limit. ``diagnose_insurance_pricing`` is the intended safeguard: a layer
    whose thickness makes the curve rate implausible will show an implied
    multiple outside the plausible range and be flagged.

    """
    Loss level associated with a given return period.

    This is the inverse of ``attachment_return_period`` and exists so that
    every instrument threshold in a strategy can be expressed on the SAME
    platform: return periods rather than dollar amounts.

    Why the platform matters
    -----------------------
    A dollar threshold means nothing on its own. The same $50M means "an event
    that happens every other year" against one loss curve and "an event that
    happens once a generation" against another. When one instrument's trigger
    was calibrated on one scale and another instrument's on a different scale,
    the resulting strategy is incoherent in a way that no single number in the
    report reveals: each instrument looks individually reasonable while the
    layering between them is arbitrary.

    That is exactly what happened in this project. The analysis was decided to
    run on total economic losses rather than on a fiscal share of them, on the
    explicit condition that instrument activation thresholds be restated on
    that same scale. The insurance attachment kept a fiscal-scale value, so it
    triggered roughly once every other year instead of once in fifteen, its
    expected payout ran an order of magnitude above what its premium implied,
    and its benefit-cost ratio came out several times too high. Nothing was
    miscalculated; two instruments were simply measured with different rulers.

    Return periods are also the platform in which the decision is actually
    taken. A finance ministry choosing sovereign cover decides how rare an
    event has to be before the instrument responds; the dollar figure is an
    output of that choice and of the loss curve, not an input. Working in
    return periods therefore makes the strategy both internally coherent and
    portable across countries and across catalogue revisions: the same
    ladder of return periods can be applied to any curve, and the dollar
    thresholds regenerate themselves.

    Recommended practice for a strategy
    -----------------------------------
    Express every threshold as a return period and lay them out as an
    increasing ladder, so each instrument covers the band where the cheaper
    ones below it have run out. The worked example uses:

        1-in-5   years : DDO trigger          (frequent, cheap debt first)
        1-in-10  years : PPO trigger          (single activation, reserved)
        1-in-15  years : insurance attachment (risk transfer starts)
        1-in-50  years : insurance exhaustion (cover fully used)

    The CCF has no loss threshold: it responds through an empirical
    population-affected function and therefore participates from the bottom
    of the curve upwards.

    Parameters
    ----------
    losses : ndarray
        Event losses, or annual losses, depending on the granularity at which
        the threshold will be applied. Use EVENT losses for instruments whose
        trigger is evaluated event by event, which is the case for insurance,
        the PPO and the DDO in this codebase. Mixing granularities
        reintroduces exactly the incoherence this function exists to prevent.
    return_period : float or sequence of float
        Return period in years.
    years_represented : float, optional
        Number of years the ``losses`` sample represents. Required when
        ``losses`` is an event sample, since the number of events is not the
        number of years. If omitted, ``losses`` is assumed to be one
        observation per year.

    -------
    float or ndarray
