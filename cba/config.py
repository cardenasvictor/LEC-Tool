LEC-CBA Configuration Module
=============================
Defines all user-configurable parameters for the cost-benefit analysis.
Instruments aligned to the BID's LEC tool base code:
  - CCRIF (standard_insurance_payout) — parametric insurance
  - PPO   (apply_ppo_coverage)        — contingent credit, single activation
  - CCF   (ccf_coverage)              — contingent credit, recurrent activation
  - DDO   (ddo_coverage)              — deferred drawdown option, recurrent

Additionally includes configuration for:
  - DRR (Disaster Risk Reduction) — ex-ante investment in prevention

NOTE: All monetary values in M USD (millions of US dollars).
