drm.py — LEC Tool
==================
Disaster Risk Management (DRM) financial instruments.

Each instrument is implemented as a stateless payout function that maps a
sequence of event losses (in chronological order within a single simulation)
to a sequence of payouts.  A strategy-level function applies multiple
instruments in combination across all simulations.

All functions are pure (no file I/O, no plotting).

Instruments implemented
-----------------------
standard_insurance_payout   Parametric/indemnity coverage with attachment and exhaustion.
apply_ppo_coverage          Contingent credit (PPO) activated once per catalogue.
ccf_coverage                Contingent credit facility (CCF) with cumulative depletion.
ddo_coverage                Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO) with a loss trigger threshold.

Pipeline function
-----------------
apply_strategy  Apply a set of DRM instruments to every simulation in a catalogue.

    Apply parametric insurance coverage to a sequence of event losses.

    Two independent policy features are configurable: how much the policy
    pays when it triggers (*payout_mode*) and how often it may trigger
    within a policy year (*one_payout_per_year*). The defaults reproduce the
    behaviour of earlier versions exactly.

    Payout modes
    ------------
    ``'proportional'`` (default)
        The insurer pays ``ceding_percentage`` of the loss lying inside the
        layer [attachment_point, exhaustion_point]:

            payout = min(max(L - AP, 0), EP - AP) * ceding_percentage

        A loss just above the attachment point produces a small payout; a
        loss at or beyond the exhaustion point produces the full coverage
        limit. This is how commercial CCRIF policies actually work, and it
        is why the exhaustion point and the ceding percentage both appear in
        a real quotation: together they define the coverage limit, and the
        distance between attachment and exhaustion defines the ramp.

    ``'binary'``
        Any loss above the attachment point pays the full coverage limit:

            payout = (EP - AP) * ceding_percentage   if L > AP, else 0

        Nothing is prorated. This is a teaching simplification, adopted for
        the worked example so that the mechanism can be explained and drawn
        without a ramp: cross the threshold, collect the cover. It should
        not be presented as the contractual behaviour of a real policy.

    Coverage reset
    --------------
    ``one_payout_per_year=False`` (default)
        Coverage resets for every individual event. A year with three
        qualifying events produces three payouts, each up to the full limit,
        with no additional premium. This is the behaviour of earlier
        versions of this codebase.

    ``one_payout_per_year=True``
        The policy pays at most once per policy year. Once it has paid, it
        is spent for the remainder of that year even if the payout was well
        below the coverage limit; cover is restored only at renewal, when
        the next annual premium is paid. This matches the contractual
        reality described by the project team. Requires *event_years*.

    Why both features matter, and why they must be decided together
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    The two features push the expected payout in OPPOSITE directions, so
    adopting one without the other gives a misleading picture. Measured on
    the worked example's historical catalogue (Honduras hurricane, 1974-2024,
    layer $50M-$190M, ceding 6.6%, coverage limit $9.24M):

        Rule                                  Expected payout   vs default
        ----------------------------------    ---------------   ----------
        per event  + proportional (default)      $2.138M/yr         ---
        per event  + binary                      $4.711M/yr        +120%
        one/year   + proportional                $1.038M/yr         -51%
        one/year   + binary                      $2.718M/yr         +27%

    Of the 26 events that generate a payout over the 51-year record, 11 are
    the second or later qualifying event within the same calendar year. That
    concentration is what makes the reset rule worth half the expected
    payout.

    Consequence for pricing coherence
    ---------------------------------
    Under binary payout with one payout per year, the actuarially pure
    Rate-on-Line collapses to the annual probability that the policy
    triggers, which is the reciprocal of the attachment point's return
    period:

        pure ROL = P(trigger in a year) = 1 / RP(attachment)

    On the worked example that is 15 triggering years out of 51, or 29.4 per
    cent, against a return period of 3.4 years. This resolves an
    inconsistency that appeared while calibrating the premium: a broker
    indication curve quoted as ROL against attachment return period implied
    implausible cost multiples of 4 to 8 when applied to a wide proportional
    layer, because such curves are quoted for THIN layers, where touching
    the attachment point is nearly equivalent to exhausting the limit.
    Binary payout is exactly that limiting case, and under it the same
    curve implies a cost multiple of about 1.26, which is commercially
    plausible.

    It also yields a closed form for the benefit-cost ratio of insurance
    that mirrors the one for credit instruments:

        B/C = (1 + f_B) / cost multiple

    where the cost multiple is premium over expected payout. At an
    actuarially fair premium the ratio equals (1 + f_B) exactly. The
    benefit-cost ratio of an insurance instrument therefore measures the
    loading paid over expected loss, just as the ratio for a concessional
    loan measures the subsidy received. Neither ratio measures protection,
    which is why neither should be the headline indicator for judging
    whether cover is worth buying.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : array_like
        Event loss amounts ($MM), in chronological order.
    attachment_point : float, default 15
        Loss level ($MM) at which coverage begins.
    exhaustion_point : float, default 50
        Loss level ($MM) at which coverage is fully exhausted.
    ceding_percentage : float, default 0.5
        Share of losses covered within the layer (0 - 1).
    payout_mode : {'proportional', 'binary'}, default 'proportional'
        See above.
    one_payout_per_year : bool, default False
        See above. Requires *event_years*.
    event_years : array_like of int, optional
        Policy year index of each event, same length as *values*. Only
        consulted when *one_payout_per_year* is True. The worked example
        uses calendar years for clarity; in practice CCRIF policies renew
        on 1 June, ahead of the Atlantic hurricane season, so a policy year
        straddles two calendar years. For a hurricane-only catalogue the
        two conventions rarely differ, because the season falls inside a
        single calendar year, but the choice should be stated explicitly
        whenever the peril is not seasonal.
    minimum_payout : float, default 0.0
        Payout floor ($MM) for any event that triggers the policy. Sovereign
        parametric pools pay at least the annual gross premium whenever the
        policy is triggered, even when the proportional ramp would give
        less. The floor never exceeds the coverage limit and has no effect
        under the binary rule, which already pays the full limit.

    Returns
    -------
    list of float
        Insurance payout for each event ($MM). Same length as *values*.

    Apply a Pre-arranged Parametric Option (PPO) to a sequence of event losses.

    The PPO activates at most once per catalogue.  Two activation rules are
    supported, selected with *trigger_mode*.

    ``trigger_mode='loss'``
        The PPO activates at the first event whose loss exceeds
        ``ppo_loss_trigger``.  This is the instrument's own threshold and
        makes the PPO independent of the other instruments in the strategy.

    ``trigger_mode='ccf'``
        The PPO activates at the first event that also activates the CCF.
        This reproduces the behaviour of the merged BID codebase and is the
        default so existing configurations are unaffected.  Because the CCF
        activates on small, frequent events, this rule tends to consume the
        PPO's single activation early in the horizon, while the available
        amount is still ramping up.

    In both modes, *require_available_funds* prevents the single activation
    from being consumed by an event at which no funds are available.  Under
    the original merged code the PPO could trigger against an available
    amount of zero, disburse nothing, and stay permanently disabled for the
    rest of the horizon.

              'binary' pays the full coverage limit on any loss above the
                  attachment point. Teaching simplification.
          one_payout_per_year bool, optional, default False

        One entry per element in *drm_configs*.

    total_coverage   pandas.DataFrame, shape (simulation_number, catalogue_length)
        Sum of all instrument payouts per year per simulation.

    Notes
    -----
    For the PPO instrument, *ppo_schedule* is indexed by calendar year
    within the catalogue (year 0 = first year).  The available amount for
    each event is looked up from the year the event falls in.

    Instruments are independent: each sees the original gross loss, not the
    loss net of prior instruments.  After all per-event payouts are computed,
    a proportional cap is applied so that the total payout for any single event
    never exceeds the gross event loss.  The strategy net loss is therefore:
        net_loss = gross_loss − total_coverage  (≥ 0 by construction)
